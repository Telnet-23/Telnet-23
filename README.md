# Current Situation
Working as a Project Engineer in the UK and digging alot deeper into Cloud and DevOps. My primary learning currently consists of Linux, Git, Docker, and Python.

## Microsoft Azure
Alot of my job currently in very intergrated into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Becuase all this, all cloud resources I touch day to day are in Microsoft Azure. Due to my hands on experience with Azure, I am learning this as my primary CSP.

## Python
I come from an infrastructure background having worked as a Systems Administrator and have a strong base knowledge in servers and networking. Given its use cases for system management, network automation, and its cloud use cases, the programming language I have chosen to double down on is Python. I do not consider myself a natural coder but I can get by. Practice makes perfect.

## Homelab
I will upload the repo for my home lab once I'm at a point where the whole things is running on bare metal Kubernetes and can all be deployed and managed via IaC. I'm currently sporting:
