## Terry Knight
Based in the UK, working as a Project Engineer, I am focused on advancing my expertise in Cloud Engineering and DevOps culture. I'm currently focusing on expanding my skill set in Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Python, and then trying to automate full deployments with GitHub Actions and/or Azure DevOps. 

My primary background is in infrastructure and networking so my Linux and networking skills have already built a great baseline. I'm now just trying to fill those gaps, dig deeper into Aazure and really get a good gasp of containerisation, Micro-service architecture and build up my Python skills to comfortably be at that of a 'Jr. Python Dev' level. 

## Microsoft Azure
I landed on Microsoft Azure as it was in use at work. I have nothing against AWS or GCP, it's just that I've never needed to use them. To advance my skills and career I sat and passed AZ-900 and AZ-104 and will eventualy look to do AZ-400 once I'm comfortable in my ability to showcase and demonstrate my proficency in Azure DevOps. I dont believe in haveing the paper without the skills. 

## Python
I started learning Python a few years back but my current position doesnt really call for it a lot. I know it's important and I know I need to improve. The only way to do that is to do it daily. You wil find a Repo where by I'm working through Dr Angela Yu's 100 days of Python bootcamp which goes from very basic, to pretty advanced Python. By the time I get to the end, I will have no excuse to being bad at it. I'll also have 100 projects in GitHub to showcase my python abilities.

## Homelab
To further develop my skills, I am building a homelab environment, which will be showcased in GitHub once fully operational on bare metal Kubernetes, fully orchestrated via Infrastructure as Code. Before I can do that, I need to learn Kubernetes better and IaC. My current hardware includes:

2x Dell Optiplex 7060 (recycled office machines)
  - Proxmox v9.0 cluster
    - 3x RHEL VMs (preparation for RHCSA certification)
  - 16GB DDR4 RAM, 500GB SSD, Intel Core i7-8700 Hexa Core

QNAP TS-563 NAS

Lenovo X260 Laptop running Fedora KDE Plasma 42 (16GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, Intel Core i5-6300U)

1x Azure subcription

This setup enables me to experiment with real-world cloud and DevOps scenarios, deepen my expertise in automation and orchestration, and refine my technical portfolio through hands-on learning.
