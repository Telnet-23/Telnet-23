## Terry Knight
Based in the UK, working as a Project Engineer, I am focused on advancing my expertise in Cloud Engineering and DevOps practices. I'm currently expanding my skill set in Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, and Python, and aiming to automate full deployments with GitHub Actions and/or Azure DevOps.

My primary background is in infrastructure and networking, so my Linux and networking skills have already built a great baseline. I'm now working to fill those gaps, dig deeper into Azure, and really get a good grasp of containerisation, microservice architecture, and build up my Python skills to comfortably reach the level of a 'Junior Python Developer'.

I've recently completed KodeKlouds 100 Days of DevOps challange to test my existing skills and learn a bunch of new ones: https://github.com/Telnet-23/100DaysDevOps

## Microsoft Azure
I landed on Microsoft Azure as it was in use at work. I have nothing against AWS or GCP; it's just that I've never needed to use them. To advance my skills and career, I sat and passed AZ-900 and AZ-104 and will eventually look to do AZ-400 once I'm comfortable in my ability to showcase and demonstrate my proficiency in Azure DevOps. I don’t believe in having the paper without the skills.

I'm currently working through KodeKlouds 100 Days of Cloud on the Azure track (it's only 50 days) to showcase some Azure skills: https://github.com/Telnet-23/50DaysOfAzure

## Python
I started learning Python a few years back, but my current position doesn’t really call for it much. I know it's important and I know I need to improve. The only way to do that is to practise daily. You will find a repo where I'm working through Dr Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python bootcamp, which goes from very basic to pretty advanced Python. By the time I get to the end, I will have no excuse for being bad at it. I'll also have 100 projects in GitHub to showcase my Python abilities:

## Homelab
To further develop my skills, I am building a homelab environment, which will be showcased on GitHub once fully operational on bare-metal Kubernetes, fully orchestrated via Infrastructure as Code. Before I can do that, I need to learn Kubernetes better and IaC. My current hardware includes:

- 2× Dell Optiplex 7060 (recycled office machines) forming a Proxmox v9.0 cluster - 16GB DDR4 RAM, 500GB SSD, Intel Core i7-8700 Hexa Core in each. 
    - Cluster is running 3× RHEL VMs (preparation for RHCSA certification)
- QNAP TS-563 NAS
- Lenovo X260 Laptop running Fedora KDE Plasma 42 (16GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, Intel Core i5-6300U)
- 1× Azure subscription

This setup enables me to experiment with real-world cloud and DevOps scenarios, deepen my expertise in automation and orchestration, and refine my technical portfolio through hands-on learning.
