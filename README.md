# Current Situation
Based in the UK, working as a Project Engineer, I am focused on advancing my expertise in Cloud and DevOps technologies. My primary learning objectives currently span Linux, Git, Docker, and Python, with hands-on professional exposure to the Microsoft 365 ecosystem and a particular focus on Microsoft Azure as my go-to cloud platform.​

Given my background in infrastructure and systems administration, I have a solid foundation in server management and networking. Python has emerged as my language of choice for automation and cloud-driven solutions, especially in system and network management contexts. While not a “natural” coder, regular practice has strengthened my proficiency and confidence in technical problem-solving.

## Microsoft Azure
Daily, my work involves significant integration within the Microsoft 365 environment, and I have practical experience managing various cloud resources on Azure. This operational exposure makes Azure my primary cloud service provider, both for professional projects and ongoing learning as I advance my cloud journey.

## Python
Drawing from my systems administration history, I leverage Python for scripting, automation, and cloud orchestration tasks. Its relevance to IT and DevOps workflows makes it integral to my toolset, and I continually expand my Python skills through practical application.

## Homelab
To further develop my skills, I am building a homelab environment, which will be showcased in GitHub once fully operational on bare metal Kubernetes, fully orchestrated via Infrastructure as Code. Current hardware includes:

2x Dell Optiplex 7060 (recycled office machines)
  - Proxmox v9.0 cluster
    - 3x RHEL VMs (preparation for RHCSA certification)
  - 16GB DDR4 RAM, 500GB SSD, Intel Core i7-8700 Hexa Core (main nodes)

QNAP TS-563 NAS

Lenovo X260 Laptop running Fedora KDE Plasma 42 (16GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, Intel Core i5-6300U)

This setup enables me to experiment with real-world cloud and DevOps scenarios, deepen my expertise in automation and orchestration, and refine my technical portfolio through hands-on learning.
